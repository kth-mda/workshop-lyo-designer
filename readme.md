The workshop aims to give the reader: 
* An understanding of the basics of Linked Data and the OASIS OSLC standard.
* hands-on experience in developing OSLC servers/clients using Lyo Designer and OSLC4J.

This workshop was first given in Sweden, in May 2017.

**Note**: The projects under the "Projects At Different Steps" folder are based on  versions of Lyo from May 2017. If regenerating code with the latest version of Lyo Designer, some changes to the code structures will be noticed.
